# PaperModY

PaperModY is a forked version of [PaperModX](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod), # fix the link here

I made this theme for my personal blog, I am not an expert in Hugo or Web Development, but I am pretty opinionated about the UI and the design, and wanted flexibility to change the theme to my liking.

Changes:
- HoverImage effect
- Image class with custom style class 
- Extra social icons [Artstation]
- NavBar search icon
